## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security vulnerability, **do not create a public issue**. Instead, report it via:

Include the following information in your report:

- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability
- Expected vs. actual behavior
- Potential impact
- Environment details (OS, project version, dependencies)

Optional: Encrypt your report using our [PGP key](link-to-your-public-key) for added security.

We aim to acknowledge reports within 48 hours and provide updates until the issue is resolved.

## Response Process
1. Confirm receipt of the report.
2. Triage and assess severity.
3. Develop and test a fix.
4. Release a patch and notify users.
5. Public disclosure occurs **after a fix is available**.

## Security Best Practices
- Always use the latest project version.
- Avoid exposing sensitive data in public repositories.
- Apply security updates promptly.

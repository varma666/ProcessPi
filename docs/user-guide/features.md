# Features

Process PI is built around a **modular architecture** that covers a wide range of process engineering tasks.  
Here’s what you can do with it:

---

## 🔢 Units & Conversions

- Consistent **SI and Imperial units** support.  
- Built-in converters for **length, pressure, temperature, time, mass, and more**.  
- Error-free calculations with automatic unit checking.

---

## 🧪 Components & Properties

- Library of **chemical components** (e.g., Acetic Acid, Water, Hydrocarbons).  
- Physical and thermodynamic properties:
  - Density, viscosity, heat capacity.  
  - Phase change data.  
  - Correlations for engineering use.

---

## 🔄 Pipelines & Networks

- Pressure drop calculations across pipes.  
- Pipeline network solver with **flow distribution**.  
- Ready for integration with pumps, valves, and control elements.

---

## 🌡️ Heat Transfer

- Heat flux, thermal conductivity, and temperature profiles.  
- Support for common **heat exchanger calculations**.  
- Extendable to advanced heat transfer modules.

---

## 📊 Examples & Workflows

- Worked examples for pipelines, pumps, and heat flux.  
- Designed to be **Jupyter-friendly** for teaching and research.  
- API reference for advanced customizations.

---

## 🛠️ Extensibility

- Add your own **components** with property data.  
- Define custom **equipment models**.  
- Flexible enough to plug into **larger simulation frameworks**.

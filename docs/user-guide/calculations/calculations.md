# ProcessPI Calculations Overview

The **ProcessPI `CalculationEngine`** is a comprehensive tool designed for chemical and process engineering calculations. It supports multiple unit systems, handles unit conversions automatically, and provides robust methods for solving a wide range of engineering problems. The engine is modular, allowing computations for individual properties or complex sequences of calculations.

# Introduction

Welcome to **ProcessPI** ‚Äî an open-source Python library for **chemical and process engineering**.  
Our goal is to provide engineers, researchers, and students with **intuitive, reliable, and extensible tools** for modeling, simulation, and design.

Process PI brings together a collection of **units, components, pipelines, and calculation utilities** into a consistent and easy-to-use framework.  
It is designed to be **lightweight enough for quick prototyping**, yet **powerful enough for industrial applications**.

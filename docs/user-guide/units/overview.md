# Units Overview

The **Process PI Units Module** provides a consistent framework for handling physical and chemical units commonly used in process and chemical engineering.  
This section gives an overview of all supported quantities, conversion rules, and their role in engineering calculations.

## 📏 Fundamental Units

- **[Length](length.md):** Handles different units of distance such as meters, centimeters, inches, and feet.  
- **[Pressure](pressure.md):** Conversion between Pascal, bar, atm, psi, and other industrial units.  
- **[Temperature](temperature.md):** Celsius, Kelvin, Fahrenheit, and Rankine conversions.  
- **[Mass](mass.md):** Mass measurements in kg, g, lb, ton, etc.  
- **[Volume](volume.md):** Cubic meters, liters, gallons, barrels, and more.  
- **[Area](area.md):** 2D measurements such as m², cm², and ft².  
- **[Diameter](diameter.md):** Specialized length property for circular geometries.

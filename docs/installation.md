# Linux / macOS
source .venv/bin/activate
# Windows 
.venv\Scripts\activate      
```
Install ProcessPI inside it:

```
pip install processpi
```

## üìì Using in Jupyter Notebook

ProcessPI works inside Jupyter Notebooks.
First, install Jupyter:

```
pip install jupyter
```
Launch

```
jupyter notebook
```
Inside a notebook, you can import ProcessPI:

```
from processpi.units import Length, Pressure
print(Length(1, "m").to("ft"))
```

---

## üåê Using in Google Colab

You can use ProcessPI directly in Colab notebooks.

At the top of your Colab notebook, run:

```python
!pip install processpi
```

Then import as usual:
```python
from processpi.components import Water
print(Water().density())
```

---
## ‚úÖ Verification

After installation, verify ProcessPI is available:
```python
import processpi
print("ProcessPI version:", processpi.__version__)
```

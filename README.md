Features

‚öôÔ∏è Unit Conversion System ‚Äì Seamless conversion across SI, CGS, and Imperial units

üß™ Components Database (Work in Progress) ‚Äì Includes 25 educational chemical and thermodynamic components (Water, Ethanol, CO‚ÇÇ, etc.), continuously expanding

üè≠ Equipment Design Modules (Work in Progress) ‚Äì Pumps, pipelines, heat exchangers, reactors, and more

üåê Pipeline Networks ‚Äì Analyze single pipes and networked series/parallel pipelines, compute flow, pressure drops, velocity, and Reynolds numbers

üìä Simulation Tools (Upcoming) ‚Äì Steady-state and dynamic process analysis, flow optimization, and energy management

Installation

Install via PyPI:

pip install processpi

Getting Started
1. Unit Conversions
from processpi.units import Length, Pressure, Temperature

# Length
l1 = Length(1.5, "m")
print(l1.to("ft"))

# Pressure
p = Pressure(2, "bar")
print(p.to("Pa"))

# Temperature
t = Temperature(100, "C")
print(t.to("K"))

2. Components
from processpi.components import Water, Ethanol

water = Water()
ethanol = Ethanol()

print(f"Water density: {water.density()} kg/m¬≥")
print(f"Ethanol viscosity: {ethanol.viscosity()} Pa.s")


‚ö†Ô∏è Educational Use Only: Component data is provided for learning and demonstration purposes. More components will be added continuously.

3. Pipeline Network Analysis
from processpi.pipelines.engine import PipelineEngine
from processpi.pipelines.pipes import Pipe
from processpi.components import Water
from processpi.units import VolumetricFlowRate, Diameter, Length

pipe = Pipe(internal_diameter=Diameter(50, "mm"), length=Length(10, "m"))

engine = PipelineEngine()
engine.fit(
    flowrate=VolumetricFlowRate(0.001, "m^3/s"),
    pipe=pipe,
    fluid=Water()
)

results = engine.run()
engine.summary()


Pipeline Network Features & Future Plans:

Analyze complex branching and parallel pipelines

Dynamic flow simulations and transient analysis

Cost and energy optimization for network layouts

Roadmap

Expand Components Database to 50+ common fluids and chemicals

Add steady-state and dynamic process simulation modules

Implement energy optimization and cost analysis tools

GUI/web interface for interactive simulations and visualizations

Integration with real process data and sensor-driven workflows
